Bridge optimization and 2D stress-strain analyses

There is 2 optimization for the truss bridge. First one is the clasical aproach which works really good(in the assemble forces file) and the second one is with Gradient-Decent algorithm(in the GD file) which works not fine. Possible reasons of that might be:
1. I did the math wrong.(It looks fine actually)
2. There are some bugs in the code.(More likely because I trimmed out bunch of bugs through out the process)

And there is also 2D stress and strain analyses(in the 2dd file) of the basic 2D shapes with extension, expansion and shear options.
